Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are
inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing
access to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be
accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. For
this reason, encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.
Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data
being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data
and code is tightly controlled by an interface.
The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code
without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this feature Encapsulation
gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.
